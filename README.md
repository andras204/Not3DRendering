Project for basics of C# course

The main aim of the project is to showcase a method of rendering used by Wolfenstein 3D:
Casting rays in a 2D plane, and scaling vertical lines on the screen based on distance to create the illusion of depth.

The project only uses `.NET Framework`, no other dependecies.
